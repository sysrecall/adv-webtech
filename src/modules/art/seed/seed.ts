        "description": "Van Gogh's painting The Starry Night depicts an expressive, turbulent night sky with swirling blues, a bright crescent moon, and radiating stars, contrasted with a peaceful village below and towering, flame-like cypress trees. Painted in 1889 from his asylum window, the masterpiece uses thick, textured brushstrokes to convey intense emotion, making it a celebrated example of modern art.",
